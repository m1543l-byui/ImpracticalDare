# ImpracticalDare
# Overview
This is a simple game written in Python. 
It is based off the tv show "Impractical Jokers"
To play the game, you get a group of friends and enter the names into the program.
You will select a DARE file that contains challanges seen in the show for you and your friends to perform.
Once you have players entered and the file selected, the program will use the 'random' library to select a random challenge from the file.
To keep track of score, I initialized an array that pulls the names of the players entered with an initial score of 0.
A for loop will prompt if each player performed the challenge or denied. If performed, the player gets +1 point.
The names are then printed with their score.
The player with the least points at the end of the game will the receive a punishment that can't be denied.
